# Advent-of-Code-2023-Rust

To run problems for each day use the following command in your termianl (You will need a Rust build-system like Cargo installed):

    -   cargo run --bin day10

You can view the solutions for my puzzle inputs by viewing the assert statement in the main function, as well as the puzzle inputs themselves so you can check your own solutions :D
    -   assert_eq!(answer_2, 349);
